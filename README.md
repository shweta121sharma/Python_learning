This are the scripts which I have made to understand some basic phenomenons in Atmosphere and in Ocean. This scripts contains Regression plots mainly JRA55-do Nino3.4 regressed slp, wind stress, Sea surface height, Sea surface temprature.
Data Source:
1. For calculating nino3.4 series, Sea surface temperature data taken from ACCESS-OM2 model from 1958-2018.
2. For Sea level pressure, wind stress and sea surafce height, sst data also taken from ACCESS-OM2 model from 1958-2018.

I have used cosima-cookbook as a base for making my scripts.

To do:
1. Adding figures in read.md file.
2. Need to add trend scripts and significance test scripts.
